            In winter I get up at night
            And dress by yellow candle-light.
            In summer, quite the other way,
            I have to go to bed by day.
            
            I have to go to bed and see
            The birds still hopping on the tree,
            Or hear the grown-up people's feet
            Still going past me in the street.
            
            And does it not seem hard to you,
            When all the sky is clear and blue,
            And I should like so much to play,
            To have to go to bed by day?
